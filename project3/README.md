A list of names I sniffed from devices on the airport's wifi.

I used Wireshark to monitor which devices were using the airport's wifi for about 15 minutes and came up with around 20,000 results. Most of the devices were repeat hits from every time it sent or received a communication. Much of the information was uninteresting. For example, here's one of my laptop's communications:


"10587","236.833732","172.22.35.60","224.0.0.251","MDNS","86","Standard query 0x0000 AAAA Crystals-MacBook-Pro.local, ""QU"" question"


A lot of other people had real names for their devices as well, some with full names. I went through about half of the results and pulled these 100 names. For anyone with a full name, I censored most of the last name for this project. But, I also looked them up on Facebook or Twitter and went through their feeds and took screenshots. Again, I tried to make the project interesting without revealing too much about anyone to keep them anonymous. I doubt most people know they are broadcasting this information.

I really liked that one person just named their device Dad. Or maybe his kid(s) set it up for him. The things that people frequently had in common were sports, Jimmy Fallon, Eminem, posting pictures of themselves and a habit of posting uplifting quotes. Overall, going through people's accounts was quite boring. It was surprising at first, because this random selection of people seemed to be mostly pleasant and open-minded. The things I learned about them were really shallow though and I lost interest pretty quickly. I probably spent the most amount of time on the Facebook page of a woman who posted photos from all of the places she visited and they looked really beautiful and professional. We were both in Chicago during the same week in 2012. The creepiest person had no social media profiles except for a YouTube account that showed he really liked skiing and guns.

You can go through the screenshots in the img folder, but I'm thinking of presenting them in a more interesting way that is styled after the seat selection page when you buy a plane ticket.
