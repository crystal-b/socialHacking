Yuan and I made a chaotic happening for the hack the class assignment. Even though the class is small, other classmates we spoke with expressed reluctance to share their work. Sometimes it was because of technical issues, but mostly people felt that their ideas were not strong enough. We wanted to do something that would get everyone to participate, that would have no wrong response, and that would give them some creative guidance. Originally, we wanted it to be a musical performance and that our classmates could decide if or with whom they would play in harmony. 

After talking with Sam Lavigne, he suggested creating a bit of structure and playtesting the idea first. We tested giving performative tasks to people with just paper, some musical and some not, and found that people tended to select music rather than perform it and that they really enjoyed drawing their responses. Someone started making paper airplanes for their responses and sharing them that way. I also found out a lot of really personal stories from people I've been hanging out with throughout the program, which was surprising and wonderful. We ended up creating a list of various tasks to create that chaotic environment and assigned them in groups so no one would feel singled out. We then built an interface to assign the tasks and give us some control in making sure more than one person received any specific task.



Here are some of the prompts we came up with:


SPEED CHAT
Performance scenario: focus on collaboration and discovery


INSTRUCTIONS

Play your favorite childhood song

Play the theme song from a tv show that you hate

How short are short shorts?

What's the last thing your mom, dad, sibling,partner, parole officer etc. texted to you?

Send someone your favorite drink

Switch computers with someone

Post a giphy that describes what's happening right now

Post a giphy that describes your mood

Find out what someone wants to eat. Look up terrible recipes for them

Think of who you are avoiding right now. Post their equivalent movie/tv/cartoon character




If we did this again, I would try to give more than one task to each person and make more that promoted interaction. We really didn't get any of those personal stories, probably because we tested in really small groups of 2-3 people. It was easy to be casually curious in a small group and ask someone why they chose a certain response, which is how those stories came out. Also, paper airplanes.
