Twitter fixes my FOMO because it makes it easy to find people and things I like in one place. But, the constant updates stress me out and also feed that fear. I wanted to reframe the stream and make tweets into a meditative experience, something slow, deliberate and beautiful â€” a transcendental Twitter. 

Lauren helped me figure out how to combine the back end and the front end. I imagined tweets dropping in like a light rain and filling up the screen, but right now I'm just drawing drops for each tweet. It seems that Twitter limits my requests to 15 tweets at a time. I need to figure out a way to loop requests and do it slowly, so I don't also hit the 100 requests per hour limit.
